## Release 0 
- Start with `index.html`, which has several input elements and a button
- Add a script tag to the bottom of the page for your code.
- Add an event listener to the button so that it calls a makeMadLib function when clicked.
- In the makeMadLib function, retrieve the current values of the form input elements, make a story from them, and output that in the story div (like "Pamela really likes pink cucumbers.")
