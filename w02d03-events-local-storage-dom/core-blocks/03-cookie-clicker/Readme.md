[Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) is a popular 2013 incremental game. The user initially clicks on a big cookie on the screen, earning one cookie per click. You need to build a simple version of the same.


## Release 0
- Extract the cookie image from the original game and place it in the middle of your html page.
- Whenever mouse enters the cookie area,
  - the cookie gets bigger
  - the background color should change
  - new background color should fade away gradually after a while.
  - the mouse cursor changes to something better than the default.
- When mouse leaves everything gets back to normal

## Release 1
Now let's add more fun to it
- Add a score board that counts the clicks
- When user clicks the cookie, the score gets incremented by 1
- Whenever user leaves the page/tab, score halves

## Release 2
Let's make it interesting
- Add an option to save the score and reset
- When user clicks `save` button, the highscore should be stored permanently and displayed on the screen
